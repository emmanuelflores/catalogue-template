Notes for Gentleman

1-HTML resources need to be loaded as folder references. Need to check if css resources are loaded properly all the time
2-Some css and html require connectivity in order to fetch on-line resources. This should be changed to local loading
3-Modal transition might include a different animation in the future
4-The dismiss of the modal view should take care of better gesture responsiveness
