<h1>Come and see how thin</h1>
    <p>William's writing is concise and comprehensible. These are two qualities that are hard to come by in texts that deal with complex, spiraling debates on the historical nature of abstract concepts. Williams organizes chronological configurations of thought such that they fall back over themselves throughout the book. The chapters on modernism and idealism are particularly engaging.</p>
